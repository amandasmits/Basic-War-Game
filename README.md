# Basic-War-Game
war.py is a basic simulation of the card game "war" in python, which takes user input for each turn and outputs the winner and current score after each round. 

selfloopingwar.py simulates war but just runs it a set amount of times so the players can scroll through later and watch how the game played out instead of having to hit the button
